Convert your variable product dropdowns into a table of prices.

== Description ==

The WooCommerce Price Matrix plugin can be easily installed and configured on any WooCommerce enabled WordPress installation.

WPM simply replaces variable product dropdowns (with a maximum of two attributes) with a price table by harnessing the power of WooCommerce's own product variations.

WPM is packed full of useful filters and actions for any developers wanting to extend functionality on their own terms.

Features include:

* Attribute Labels
* Price Table Heading
* Quick & Easy Installation/Configuration
* Developer-friendly

== Installation ==

Installing and using WPM couldn’t be simpler:

1. Upload `/woocommerce-price-matrix/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a variable product using WooCommerce and tick the `Price Matrix` option in the product data box
5. After your variable product options have been configured, save the product and view it on the front-end

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need WooCommerce for this plugin? =

Yes, it's exclusively a WooCommerce extension - If WC is not installed the plugin will not load any scripts

= I don't want a table heading, is this possible? =

Yes, just leave the heading input blank

= I want to have more than two attributes for variations, how can I do this? =

You can't. WPM works works only with two attributes

= Can I have more attributes not saved for variations? =

Yes, you can list as many attributes not saved for variations as you would like

= What happens when I create the same variation twice? =

WPM will take your first instance of the variation and ignore any others

== Screenshots ==

1. Tick the `Price Matrix` checkbox to enable the table, additional configuration options will appear on doing so.
2. Create/manage your attributes that are `used for variation`. WPM won't allow you to tick more than two and will attempt to untick them on activation.
3. As you would a normal variable product, complete your product variations and save the product.
4. Load the product in your shop, WPM should now be displaying a table instead of dropdowns.
